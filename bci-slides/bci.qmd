# Introduction



- In these slides, we will present the ***non-invasive, active, EEG*** BCIs
- Of course, other types of brain-computer interfaces will be presented in order to provide a full picture of what is happening around.

### Tst 

## Invasive vs non-invasive

- Get in bed
- Count sheep

# Software
- The BCI functionality consists of the following:
    0. Present a prompt to the user--Optional, for synchronous BCIs
    1. Capture the brain's electrical activity
    2. Decode it (left or right, feet or hands, wrist flexion or extension etc.)
    3. Present the feedback to the user (what did the system understand, and does it agree with the user's intention?)

## Stimulus presentation software
- Takes care of point 0 and 3 of the slide above, that is, to present something to the user, such as a video, a sound, an image etc. 
- There are gazillion of tools developed for this purpose. Free (as in beer and as in liberty), non-free (as in beer and in liberty), based on Matlab or Python, standalone or as extensions etc. etc.
